# OPMxplore-Tools to explore Orientiation of Membrane Protein Dataset

![](doc/Membrane_prot.jpg)

This Python module was built for a quick and interactive exploration of the [Orientation of Membrane Protein (OPM) database](http://opm.phar.umich.edu/). The tools in this module will help to custom query membrane proteins and visualize relationships between proteins and their features. It was designed to query [RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) ans match the results with the data from the [OPM MySQL dataset](http://opm.phar.umich.edu/OPM-2016-10-10.sql).
